# Bootstrap-demo

## About
The purpose of this demo was to practice using a framework like bootstrap after first getting to know it. As a result, I checked how such things as work:
- button
- slider
- accordion
- forms
- adaptability
- bootstrap style
and others

I concluded that this framework is suitable for projects that are simple and do not require complex and unique styles.
